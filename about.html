      <p>
        <strong>Markuply</strong> is a playful and ever-growing collection of
        simple, creative web mini-projects made with just HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. It's built for anyone who loves tinkering with code —
        whether you're just starting out, looking for quick ideas, or need a fun
        coding break.
      </p>

      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        This project began as a personal experiment. I —
        <strong>Prathewsh S Babu</strong> — started building tiny web pages out
        of boredom and curiosity. One turned into five, five turned into twenty,
        and soon I realized: this deserves a name, a home, and a place to grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were no big plans, no fancy tech stacks — just raw HTML, pure CSS,
        and a dash of JavaScript magic. Markuply is a tribute to the joy of
        building things that just work and make you smile.
      </p>

      <h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
      <p>Markuply is packed with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>🕹️ Fun games (like Fruit Ninja clones, Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe)</li>
        <li>🎨 Creative UI experiments (cards, loaders, animations)</li>
        <li>🧠 Mini challenges and logic puzzles in JavaScript</li>
        <li>📚 Beginner-friendly code with clean structure</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        In a world full of frameworks and boilerplates, sometimes it's
        refreshing to go back to basics. Markuply helps developers — especially
        beginners — learn by doing. No setup, no configs, just open the browser
        and play.
      </p>

      <h2>Get Involved</h2>
      <p>
        Got a mini idea? Found a bug? Or just want to say hi? Contributions,
        feedback, and silly ideas are always welcome. You can fork the project,
        open issues, or suggest features — or simply use it for your own
        learning!
      </p>
